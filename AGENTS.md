- Apps under public/apps open independently with no profiles, trackers or dashboards, so any buddy works on its own.
- New family buddies are a small index.html config on public/apps/buddy-shared engine, with personas server-side in src/lib/buddies.ts, so prompts stay private and buddies stay consistent.
- The home puzzle is generated from src/lib/buddy-catalog.ts; a null href routes to /coming-soon/$slug so new buddies never break links.
- Every buddy answer runs Claude and Google Gemini in parallel and a cheap Gemini judge returns only the more accurate/clearer one (bestAnswer in src/lib/ai-gateway.ts), so all apps share one comparison rule.
